             [STRETCH] Feel free to add anything else you want, for example:
                * a dropdown to select number of items you want to retrieve
                * a search bar to search for a particular item
             You could even change what you can see in the search bar based on what you are searching for.
             E.g add a dropdown to determine which field you're searching on ("name"/"title"/"alias")
